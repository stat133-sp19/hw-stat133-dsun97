Introduction: The Golden State Warriors have so many talented players that continue to improve as time goes on. Ever wondered how your favorite GSW stars stack up against each other? Ever wondered truly how effective your favorite shooters are? Let's take a look at exactly how effective the shooting percentages of Iguodala, Green, Durant, Thompson, and Curry look like! These five players are definitely getting the "Wows!" out of us in their amazing 2016 season.

Take-home message: as one can conclude from the data, the meta is rapidly shifting in the nba. Revolutionary player Stephen Curry is changing the game of basketball at the highest level. Before Steph, the meta of the game was to take as many 2pt shots as possible. As 2pt shots were the most consistently taken shot with the highest value of return, it makes sense that most teams would utilize this effective shot. However, Curry changed the game in the amount of 3pt shots he took outside the line. His extreme precision and lethalness outside the 3pt line posed a huge threat and yieled a high return of points per shot attempted. From this data in the 2016 season, more teams have trained more 3pt shooters to shoot beyond the arc. The amount of 3s is the highest it has ever been. The meta has definitely shifted to an era of shooters beyond the ring.
