Chocolate Puddle Cakes
----------------------

Ingredients

-   4 tablespoons unsalted butter
-   2 teaspoons cocoa powder
-   3 ounces bittersweet chocolate
-   1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt
-   1 to 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
-   1 large egg
-   1 egg yolk

Kitchen tools

-   Tablespoon
-   Teaspoon
-   Whisk

Recipe Steps

Heat oven to 450 degrees F. Butter two 6-ounce baking cups and then spoon a little cocoa powder in each. Place four tablespoons of butter and chocolate in a bowl. Whisk in sugar and salt and then whisk in the egg and yolk. Add 2 teaspoons cocoa powder and whisk until combined. Bake for eight minutes and transfer to a cooling rack for a minute. Flip the contents on to a plate then lift the cup off after ten seconds. Dust with powdered sugar and then serve immediately.

This dish is typically eaten around Christmas time in the winter. The only variation this dish really has is to replace the chocolate with vanilla.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\bar{pq}$). In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p\_1*, *p\_2*,..., *p\_n*) and **q** = (*q\_1*, *q\_2*,..., *q\_n*) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula. *d*(**p**, **q**) = *d*(**q**, **p**) = $\\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + ... +(q\_n - p\_n)^2}$ = $\\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^n(q\_i - p\_i)^2}$ The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.

||p|| = $\\sqrt{p^2\_1 + p^2\_2 + ... + p^2\_n}$ = $\\sqrt{p \\cdot p}$ , where the last expression involves the dot product.
